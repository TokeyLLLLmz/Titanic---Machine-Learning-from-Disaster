<p>This is an exercise of using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.<br>
<p>The jupytor notebook file contains the process of data manipulation, data analysis and building model<br>
<p>A gradient boost tree model that I built archieve 76% accuracy by evaluating the test data set<br>
